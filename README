# "Emacs for the Laity" configuration


## Usage

1. Install Emacs
    * For Linux, though your distribution's package manager
    * For OSX, from [Emacs for Mac OSX](https://emacsformacosx.com/ "Installer for Emacs for Mac OSX")
    * For Windows, from the [GNU Project](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html#windows "Installer for Emacs for Windows")
1. Paste the ~.emacs~ file into your home directory (in Linux and OSX, it should be at ~\~/.emacs~).
    * For Windows, you can [alternatively paste the file](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/efaq-w32/Location-of-init-file.html "GNU.org: Naming .emacs in Windows") so that it is named ~_emacs~, if your system won't let you name a file starting with a period.
1. Start Emacs. If Emacs can see the ~.emacs~ file you moved in the step above, it should ask you whether you would like to install a series of add-ons (Press "Y" on your keyboard for each). 
1. You may then need to close and re-open Emacs.
1. If all goes well, when you open Emacs, you should be greeted with some helpful reminder text.
